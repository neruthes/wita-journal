\section*{Abstract}

In 2025's AI frenzy, few brag sheets boast more bravado than ``We're a \emph{Claude wrapper}.''
At conferences, hackathons, and booster-pitch dinners, someone inevitably leads with:
``We didn't train a model --- we integrated Claude's API in 30 minutes, wrapped a lightweight UI, and voil√†!''
Congratulations: your startup is officially ``innovative''---as long as flimsy UI counts as disruptive.

\section{The Rise of the Wrapper}

A decade ago, ``wrapper'' meant a bandage; now it's a business model.
A popular observation calls these \emph{lightweight applications} built on third-party LLM APIs, with minimal effort and complexity \cite{olivas2025linkedin}.
Indeed, startups like Manus AI---which bridges Claude with dozens of tools---are marketed as transformative,
yet critics note: ``Technically, yes --- Manus uses Claude's API connected to 29 different tools'' \cite{goldie2025manus}.

Yet that hasn't stopped the cash flow: Bolt.new, a Claude-based code agent, reportedly pulled in \emph{\$8 million ARR in two months} \cite{latent2025bolt}.
On Reddit and LinkedIn, the common refrain is: ``they may be wrappers, but their UI/bundling is what sells'' \cite{krunal2025hype}.
In short, convenience \emph{is} value --- if users pay.

\section{Why Wrappers Sell --- Even If They're Middling}

\subsection{Speed to Market}
You don't need to train a model on petabytes of data --- just spin up OpenAI's or Anthropic's API, slap on a dashboard, and you're live.

\subsection{Product-Market Fit}
Fast iteration beats slow perfection.
A wrapper with slightly better UX often trumps slower in-house models \cite{skooloflife2025dead, krunal2025hype}.

\subsection{Hype-Fueled Funding}
Startup valuations are still riding the AI bubble.
Investors throw money at any venture tagged \emph{AI}, even if it's just an API client.

Is this sustainable? Some argue that \emph{99\% of AI startups will die by 2026}---not due to fraud, but because wrappers lack defensible advantages, product moats, or infrastructure \cite{skooloflife2025dead}.

\section{The Good, the Bland, and the Ugly}

\subsection{The Good}
Wrappers democratize access.
Tools like Manus or Lumio AI let non-coders assemble workflows, compare models, and embed intelligence into documents or code --- no PhD required \cite{lumio2025}.

\subsection{The Bland}
Yet a face-emoji web app or generic chatbot? Meh.
Many wrappers add no real power---just paint. They echo the ``AI Snake Oil'' critiques by Narayanan, who warns that marketing often overshadows technical merit \cite{narayanan2023snakeoil}.

\subsection{The Ugly}
Bandwagon effects hide deeper issues:
pumps \& dumps of attention, lack of security, poor UX, bias inherited via opaque APIs, and zero explainability.
The prompt-engineer-as-founder has become a punchline---and a weak business model \cite{wiggins2024hype}.

\section{What We Lose If Wrappers Win}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Lack of innovation:} Relying on wrappers stifles model-level breakthroughs.
	\item \textbf{Commoditization:} AI becomes a plug-and-play feature, not a transformative platform.
	\item \textbf{Dependency risks:} Lock-in to API ecosystems, vendor price hikes, and downstream fragility.
	\item \textbf{Ethical opacity:} Wrappers perpetuate bias and hallucination without oversight \cite{wsj2025steam}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Where to Go from Here}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Layer up, don't wrap}: Build meaningful differentiation---team curation, proprietary finetunes, UX innovations, deep data integration.
	\item \emph{Prove real ROI}: Move past MVPs to revenue, retention, or B2B traction---beyond Buzzword Bingo.
	\item \emph{Push transparency}: Embrace explainability frameworks, model audits, and bias remediation.
	\item \emph{Prepare for shakeout}: Many wrapper ventures will fade; the survivors will innovate, not imitate \cite{reddit2025wrapper}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Final Word: Wrappers Can Blossom or Burst}

Calling yourself a ``Claude wrapper'' isn't shameful ---
but it shouldn't stop at calling. Execution, defensible strategy, and genuine impact matter.
The current hype bubble may lift all boats --- but once the tide recedes, only the ships that actually sail will remain.

So yes --- your startup might technically be a ``free Claude wrapper.''
But is it just dressing, or will it deliver substance?
That's the question investors, users, and founders must answer --- without the marketing smoke.
