Like most journals, Weight in the Attention (WITA) handles manuscript submissions.
A rare characteristic of WITA is that the submission process is based on Git, GitHub, and pull request.
This guide offers a comprehensive guide for authors in good faith of establishing an efficient manuscript acceptance workflow.
Key takeawayâ€”if you would like to submit an already published article, just open an issue and include URL to your article.
